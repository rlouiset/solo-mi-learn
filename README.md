# solo-mi-learn
This anonymous github has been constructed from solo-learn, a library of self-supervised methods for unsupervised visual representation learning powered by PyTorch Lightning.

This anonymous github is designed to provide the open-source code for the NeurIPS submission "Understanding Teacher-Student Self-Supervised Learning with Mutual Information", ID: 17893.
